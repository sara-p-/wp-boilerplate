				<p>
					Over 10 years ago (wow) I was an eager young artist, newly
					graduated with a MFA in 3D Fine Art. At some point I decided
					I needed a portfolio site, so I bought a wonderful book
					about HTML and CSS.
				</p>
				<h3>
					That was the beginning of my deep and abiding love for
					coding.
				</h3>
				<p>
					I began freelancing as a web developer while continuing to
					work as an artist. This was an exciting time spent having
					art shows, participating in artist residencies and
					fellowships, touring the States with bands, and creative
					consulting with a multinational corporation.
				</p>
				<p>
					At some point the allure of code was stronger than the
					allure of the art world, and I began freelancing as a
					developer full-time. This afforded me the chance to travel
					the world for a year with 40 strangers on Remote Year.
				</p>
				<p>
					After successfully running my own freelancing business for 5
					years, I decided that I wanted to jump in a little deeper,
					and got a job at an incredible ad agency called Mightily.
				</p>
				<p>
					Mightily is known for its incredible work and creativity.
					Working with such talented designers and developers on some
					truly challenging sites took my skillset to a whole new
					level.
				</p>
				<p>
					I’ve now been a developer for over 7 years and absolutely
					love it.
				</p>

					Let’s make something beautiful together.
